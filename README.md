# Maintenance_scheduling_problem

This repository will contain some tests, and implementations for my thesis project.

The first aim of this work is to find a maintenance schedule by minimizing the power loss for rio tinto power plants on Saguenay lac St jean.

## The bender decomposition folder 

contains a small example of bender decomposition in Julia and it solve a very small probl√®m using the standard form of a bender decomposable problem

## The determinist folder

is a representation of the hydropower system, it is maximising the power generated by the 4 powerplants. The production function are represented by hyperplanes to linearise the problem
whithout this, the problem will be a non linear optimization problem and it will be more difficult to solve.
